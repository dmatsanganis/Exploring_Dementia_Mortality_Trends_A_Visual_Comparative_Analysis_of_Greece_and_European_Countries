### Exploring Dementia Mortality Trends: A Comparative Analysis of Greece and European Countries

This analysis delves into the examination of dementia mortality trends in Greece and European countries from 2011 to 2020, with a specific focus on gender-based analysis.
The dataset used for this study is sourced primarily from Eurostat, the statistical office of the European Union. 
The objective is to conduct a comprehensive analysis using R programming to assess whether there is an increasing trend in dementia mortality 
in Greece and explore if Greece exhibits distinct behavior compared to the rest of Europe. 
The resulting presentation will present a series of visually compelling plots to convey findings and insights effectively.

To be more precise, utilizing Eurostat, the esteemed statistical office of the European Union, this analysis unravels the intricate tapestry of dementia mortality 
trends in Greece and European countries spanning the years 2011 to 2020. With a laser focus on gender-based analysis, our objective is to conduct 
a meticulous exploration using the power of R programming. Through this comprehensive approach, we aim to determine if there exists an escalating 
trend in dementia mortality in Greece and ascertain whether Greece's behavior deviates from the rest of Europe.

Within the enclosed PDF and PowerPoint files, you will find an assortment of captivating visualizations that vividly depict our findings and insights. 
These visually compelling plots have been thoughtfully crafted to convey complex information in an accessible and engaging manner.

In addition to the visual representations, in this repository we share the accompanying R code used to generate these captivating visuals. 
By perusing the code, you can gain a deeper understanding of the methodologies employed and reproduce the plots for further exploration.

An example of the created plots is the following one representing, the Average Standardised Dementia Death Rate (2011-2020).
