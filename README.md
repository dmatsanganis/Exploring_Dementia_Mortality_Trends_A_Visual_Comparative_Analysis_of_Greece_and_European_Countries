### Exploring Dementia Mortality Trends: A Comparative Analysis of Greece and European Countries

This analysis delves into the examination of dementia mortality trends in Greece and European countries from 2011 to 2020, with a specific focus on gender-based analysis.
The dataset used for this study is sourced primarily from Eurostat, the statistical office of the European Union. 
The objective is to conduct a comprehensive analysis using R programming to assess whether there is an increasing trend in dementia mortality 
in Greece and explore if Greece exhibits distinct behavior compared to the rest of Europe. 
The resulting presentation will present a series of visually compelling plots to convey findings and insights effectively.

The visualizations will be provided in a separate PowerPoint or PDF document, while the accompanying R code used to generate the plots will be shared alongside.
