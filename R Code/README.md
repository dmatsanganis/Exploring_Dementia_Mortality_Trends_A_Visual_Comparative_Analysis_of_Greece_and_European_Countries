## Dementia Mortality Trends - R Code, Datasets, and Images

This subfolder contains the R code, datasets, and images used in the analysis of dementia mortality trends in Greece and European countries.
The contents of this subfolder are essential for reproducing the analysis, generating the visualizations, and understanding the data sources.

### File Descriptions

- `dementia_analysis.R`: R script containing the code used to generate the visualizations and perform the analysis. Please refer to this script for a comprehensive understanding of the methodologies employed.
- `eu_flag.png`: Image file representing the flag of the European Union, used in the R code and visualizations.
- `greek_flag.png`: Image file depicting the flag of Greece, used in the R code and visualizations.
- `hlth_cd_aro__custom_6254082_linear.csv`: Dataset file containing relevant health data used in the analysis, such as dementia mortality occurencies. This data is sourced from Eurostat.
- `hlth_cd_asdr2__custom_6255253_linear.csv`: Dataset file comprising additional health data utilized in the analysis, such as standardized death rates. This data is also sourced from Eurostat.

### Usage

To reproduce the analysis, generate the visualizations, or explore the datasets, it is recommended to use the R code provided (`dementia_analysis.R`). 
Execute the code in an appropriate R environment, ensuring that the necessary dependencies and packages are installed.

Please note that the code references the dataset files (`hlth_cd_aro__custom_6254082_linear.csv` and `hlth_cd_asdr2__custom_6255253_linear.csv`) for data input 
and incorporates the images (`eu_flag.png` and `greek_flag.png`) for visual enhancements.
